<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![App Name Screen Shot][app-screenshot]](https://agile-crag-93359.herokuapp.com/#)

There are many great repositories templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one good search platform to search through the repositories by many filters. I created a search app in react through which you can filter and sort on repositories to find any public repository.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [React Wordcloud](https://react-wordcloud.netlify.app/)
* [GraphQL](https://developer.github.com/v4/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have npm installed!
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rashi1997/Search-Github.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Runs the app in the development mode
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

<!-- ARCHITECTURE OF THE APP -->
## Architecture

Organization of your components
How data is passed down through your components
How user interactions can trigger changes in the state of components


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The Web App can be used to search for the first 12 repositories on a keyword matching the repository name and description. The repositories listed can be filtered on language and topics and sorted on stars. The filters can also be reset. The app also allows you to bookmark repositories and view the bookmarks together with word cloud visualization.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Website](https://agile-crag-93359.herokuapp.com/#)_
